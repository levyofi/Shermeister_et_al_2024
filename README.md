### **Abstract**:
1. Behavioral thermoregulation, a critical ecological and physiological trait, profoundly influences individual fitness and species distributions, particularly in the context of climate change. However, field monitoring of this behavior remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. With the rise of camera-based surveys and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches in computer vision, we should try to build better tools for characterising animals' behavioral thermoregulation.  

2. In this study, we developed a deep learning framework to automate the detection and classification of thermoregulation behavior. We used lizards as a model animal for thermoregulation, and curated a diverse dataset of images captured by trail cameras under semi-natural conditions. Subsequently, we color-marked the lizards and trained an object-detection model to identify lizards and image-classification models to determine their thermoregulation behaviors (activity in sun or shade). We then evaluated the performance of each model and analyzed how the classification of thermoregulating lizards performed under different solar conditions (sun or shade), times of day, and marking colors.

3. Our framework's models exhibited high performance, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. The thermoregulation classification model performed significantly better on sun-basking lizards, achieving the highest classification accuracy with white-marked lizards. Moreover, the activity patterns and thermoregulation preferences of lizards, generated by our framework, closely aligned with manually annotated data.

4. Our study underscores the potential of computer vision and AI in effectively tracking behavioral thermoregulation, offering a promising new direction for camera trap studies. This approach significantly reduces the labor and time associated with ecological data collection and analysis, and can help gain a deeper understanding of species' thermal preferences and risks of climate change on species behavior.
